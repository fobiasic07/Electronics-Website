# Electronics Website

This is a personal project to learn and improve on my react developer skills. The website is a documentation site for electronics used in Cloud and Internet of Things (IoT). It will include tutorials on how to implement various IoT projects.

The languages and Libraries used for this include React, Javascript and HTML/CSS. For creating a react app, I suggest the use of Vite in this [document tutorial](https://v3.vitejs.dev/guide/) or [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/8vh5dmBaVQw?si=JrGn0k-OiHN3Dl74).

## Website Design

For the UI/UX design, I used Figma to come up with a suitable design goal. Below are images of the targeted web design flow.

### Main Page Design

The main page consists of Header, Navbar, Body and Footer Components.

The components include:
1. Header

    The header is as shown below and includes a logo, serach bar and navbar that leads to Home, Documentation or Contact located at the footer.

2. Navbar

    There are 3 navbar designs considered for the two page website, inlcluding the main page header, documentation header and headers for smaller screen sizes as shown:

3. Body

    The body will consist of topic cards that have a general summary of the respective topic.

    The topic card will have the following structure:

### Main Page On Scroll Design

    The header component image background is meant to dissappear on scrolling, yielding the design below.
